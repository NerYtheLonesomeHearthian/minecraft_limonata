# minecraft_limonata
Repository for the Minecraft mod Limonata (1.21.1).

This mod was made with MCreator.

Description (from Modrinth): â†“

This is a mod primarily made for me and my group of friends, the Limonari.

The contents are slim for now, but I am actively developing small updates.

For now, the things added are:

- a music disc (Limonata Chiamata)

There probably will not be any big addition such as new dimensions or game-breaking recipes.

My intention with this mod is to add small cute additions that are a kind of inside jokes between me and my friends, but also some little features in the themes of lemon&lemonade, which everybody can enjoy. For example at the moment i'm implementing Lemonade as a food/drink as well as lemons with their plant.

This mod was made with MCreator.

Hope you enjoy!
